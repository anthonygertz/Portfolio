## Comparative Flood Resiliency Across Time for the Southeastern United States
Created a dashboard in R to compare flooding related disaster damages and impacts across the Southeastern United States by county and state. An in-depth readme of the application's function, hypothetical question, methodology, limitations, and data sources can be found in the link below:

## Exploration of Variance in Neural Network Training
Explored how widely Nerual Network training randomizes model fitting over repeated iterations and across the same data. Six thousand models were independently trained using 7, RTX 30 series GPUs in a Docker container in an Ubuntu environment.

## Covid19 Business Violations
Explored COVID-19 violations reported to hubNashville, the metro government's comprehensive customer service system. My contribution included an interactive Folium map with marker clusters, popup tooltips on individual observations, and exploration into intentionally false submissions.

## Earthquake Exploration
Engaged in exploratory data analysis in an attempt to find trends as they relate to earthquakes. My investigation focused on loss of life and injury count variations given the time of day an earthquake occurred.

## Kaggle Competition - Permeability
Participated in a closed Kaggle competition predicting permeability to familiarize ourselves with multiple machine learning algorithms, their strengths, and their limitations. 

Tensorflow models were trained through GPUs instead of CPUs. The following models were thoroughly evaluated for performance: Linear Regression (Polynomial), Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron Regressor, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks along with numerous types of scalers, and validation and hyperparameter tuning (XGBoost, KFold Cross Validation).

## Vanderbilt University ACCRE Labs
Explored and analyzed job runs on ACCRE's supercomputer. Assessed variations between successful and failed computing runs in attempt to isolate problematic hardware, user errors, and job parameter optimization.
