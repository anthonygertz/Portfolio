## Comparative Flood Resiliency Across Time for the Southeastern United States
Created a dashboard in R to compare flooding related disaster damages and impacts across the Southeastern United States by county and state. An in-depth readme of the application's function, hypothetical question, methodology, limitations, and data sources can be found in the link below:

## Covid19 Business Violations
Explored COVID-19 violations reported to hubNashville, the metro government's comprehensive customer service system. 

## Earthquake Exploration
Engaged in exploratory data analysis in an attempt to find trends as they relate to earthquakes. My investigation focused on loss of life and injury count variations given the time of day an earthquake occurred. 

## Kaggle Competition - Permeability
Participated in a closed Kaggle competition predicting permeability to familiarize ourselves with multiple machine learning algorithms, their strengths, and their limitations. 

## Vanderbilt University ACCRE Labs
Explored and analyzed job runs on ACCRE's supercomputer. Assessed variations between successful and failed computing runs in attempt to isolate problematic hardware, user errors, and job parameter optimization.
