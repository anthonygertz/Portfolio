## Comparing Disaster Resiliency for the Southeastern United States
## Measuring Differences in Disasters Effects Across Time to Assess How Growth Affects Resiliency
https://github.com/anthonygertz/MIDTERM_Gertz
Created a dashboard in R to compare flooding related disaster damages and impacts across the Southeastern United States by county and state. An in-depth readme of the application's function, hypothetical question, methodology, limitations, and data sources can be found in the link below:

## Neural Networks
## Testing Variance of Model Training to Establish Predictive Limitations and Bounds
https://github.com/anthonygertz/Portfolio/tree/main/variance_NN
Explored how widely Nerual Network training randomizes model fitting over repeated iterations and across the same data. Six thousand models were independently trained using 7, RTX 30 series GPUs in a Docker container in an Ubuntu environment.

## Covid19 Business Violations
## Web Scraping, Address Matching, and Interactive Mapping to Identify Reporting Inaccuracies and Geospatial Clusters
https://github.com/anthonygertz/Portfolio/tree/main/covid
Explored COVID-19 violations reported to hubNashville, the metro government's comprehensive customer service system. My contribution included an interactive Folium map with marker clusters, popup tooltips on individual observations, and exploration into intentionally false submissions.

## Earthquakes
## Identifying Trends and Examining Historical Earthquake Data
https://github.com/anthonygertz/Portfolio/tree/main/earthquakes
Engaged in exploratory data analysis in an attempt to find trends as they relate to earthquakes. My investigation focused on loss of life and injury count variations given the time of day an earthquake occurred.

## Kaggle Competition
## Testing Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict True Values Across a Complex Dataset
https://github.com/anthonygertz/Portfolio/tree/main/kaggle_ML
Familiarize ourselves with multiple machine learning algorithms, their strengths, and their limitations by participating in a closed Kaggle competition predicting rock permiability. 

Tensorflow models were trained through GPUs instead of CPUs. The following models were thoroughly evaluated for performance: Linear Regression (Polynomial), Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron Regressor, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks along with numerous types of scalers, and validation and hyperparameter tuning (XGBoost, KFold Cross Validation).

## Vanderbilt University ACCRE Labs
## Isolating Anomlyous Behavior to Identify Potentially Faulty Nodes and User Errors
https://github.com/anthonygertz/Portfolio/tree/main/accre
Explored and analyzed job runs on ACCRE's supercomputer. Assessed variations between successful and failed computing runs in attempt to isolate problematic hardware, user errors, and job parameter optimization.
